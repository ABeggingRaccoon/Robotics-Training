    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "Tabular data is data that is organized into rows and columns. It's everywhere -- in newspapers and magazines, on websites, in computer databases, and in Microsoft Excel files. Evaluating and manipulating tabular data is an essential skill for any analyst.\n",
    "\n",

    "### A. CSV File Structure\n",
    "Tabular data is often stored in comma separated value (CSV) files. CSV files are text files that use commas and newline characters (I'll explain what those are shortly) to organize the contents of the file into a table. Let's look at an example. The `space.csv` file contains information on 4,324 space launches, starting with the launch of the the Sputnik spacecraft by the Soviet Union in 1957. The dataset is available on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957). The Python code below opens the file and displays the first five lines."

    "In the expression, we're taking the `Series` object returned by the expression `space_df[\"Company Name\"]` and we're comparing it to the string \"US Navy\". Pandas then checks every single element (all 4,324) to the string \"US Navy\", generating a value of True if the value is equal to \"US Navy\" and False otherwise. This action generates 4,234 True or False values, which Pandas returns as a `Series`. An operation that is repeated on every single element of an array-like object (e.g., list, array, Series) is called an element-wise or vectorized operation. One of the benefits of using Pandas is it is capable of many element-wise operations. Not having to write a `for` loop is convenient and makes code more concise. Also, element-wise operations are often faster than operations that use `for` loops.\n",

    "When we pass a `Series` of Boolean values to the dataframe by placing it in square brackets, Pandas will return another dataframe with only the rows that correspond to values of True in the Boolean series. Let's experiment. The following cell generates a Boolean series that is the same length as `space_df`, with every value set to `False`."

    "#### 3. Reason for Having Indexes - The `.loc()` Method\n",
    "Why do Pandas dataframes have an index? The size of a Pandas dataframe is limited only by the amount of memory on your computer.  Pandas dataframes can have millions of rows -- that's not hyperbole. The designers of Pandas wanted to be able to extract data from dataframes quickly, regardless of the size of the dataframe. The `Index` objects make that possible. If we extract data using index values and column names, we can extract data just as quickly from large datasets as we can from small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a caveat. For indexing (i.e., extracting data) to be fast on large dataframes, each row and column must have a unique index value. Pandas will allow duplicate index values, but some operations will be slower, and there could be other problems. The best practice is to ensure each row and column has a unique index value. Your choice of index will depend on the data and how you want to use it."
